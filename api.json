      "full": "The Hessdalen Lights are unexplained light phenomena occurring in the Hessdalen valley of Norway. Peak activity occurred between 1981-1984 with 20+ sightings per week, though the phenomenon continues today at lower frequency. Characterized by bright white or yellow lights, sometimes colored, that hover or move and can last from seconds to hours. Project Hessdalen, established in 1984, maintains the only permanent scientific monitoring station for a ghost light phenomenon, using cameras, radar, spectrum analyzers, and magnetometers. Measurements confirm an actual physical phenomenon, not hallucinations or hoaxes. Leading theories include plasma created by piezoelectric effects, ionized dust/gas, earthquake lights, and combustion of scandium particles found in air samples during light events. The phenomenon remains unexplained but scientifically documented."
