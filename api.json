      "full": "The Hessdalen Lights are unexplained light phenomena occurring in the Hessdalen valley of central Norway. What makes this phenomenon unique in the world of \\\"ghost lights\\\" is that it is the **only one with permanent scientific monitoring equipment** and has been studied continuously since 1984. Peak activity occurred between 1981-1984, with locals reporting 20+ sightings per week. While frequency has decreased, the phenomenon continues today and remains under scientific observation through Project Hessdalen, established by Norwegian and international researchers. The lights are characterized by bright white or yellow colors (sometimes red, orange, or other hues), can hover or move rapidly, float down the valley or over mountains, and last anywhere from a few seconds to several hours. Unlike many other \\\"mystery light\\\" phenomena, the Hessdalen Lights have been **confirmed as a real physical phenomenon** through instrumental detection including cameras, radar, spectrum analyzers, and magnetometers. Despite extensive scientific study, the cause remains debated. Leading theories include plasma created by piezoelectric effects, combustion of scandium particles (found in air samples during light events), ionized dust/gas, and earthquake lights."
